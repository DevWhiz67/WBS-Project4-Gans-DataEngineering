# WBS-School-Project3-Gans-DataEngineering
Gans Case from WBS Coding School in the Data Engineering Module

As part of the data engineering module, my duty was to assist a startup, Gans, in establishing an e-scooter sharing system. The challenge? To predict the unpredictable: e-scooter movement across the city, ensuring they're parked just where users need them. This required real-time availability of data on cities, airports, flights, and weather for all within the company and necessitated the construction and automation of a cloud-based data pipeline.

The project was split up into the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting data through webscraping or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Data Storage: Creating a Database in MySQL and storing the data there
- Pipeline to the Cloud: Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to move the pipeline into the cloud
- Pipeline Automation: Automating data collection and storage process

The functions used for data collection and storage and the development steps I went through as well as the structure of the tables in MySQL can be found in this repository.
